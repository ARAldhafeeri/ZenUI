### dom

First version onf zenaura virtual dom, with two main functions mount, render. 

- Mount
    - compile the zenaura Nodes into HTML , sanitize and escape text, then set div with id=root innerHTML to the compiled component html.
    - Update the virtual dom table with componentId and component tree.
- Render
    - will fetch the previous tree from virtual dom table and use the component node method to rerender a fresh version.
    - uses virtual dom search method to effectively return diff the updated nodes.
    - iterate over the diffed node lists , compile each diffed node then update the  real dom.
- search : diffing algorithm in virtual dom.
- update : part of the diffing algorithm, sync virtual dom with real dom.

---

### compiler

- compile zenui nodes and attributes tree into html.
- escapes inner html texts

---

### component

- assign unique componentId for each instance for the virtual dom.
- local state variable.
- refactored state management into observer pattern as Subject and Observer.

---

### router

- Simple client side router mount container components on the real dom based on route change.

---

### app

- sttill need to know what to do with it, currently itâ€™s just component.

---

### Observer

- observer design pattern implementation
- allow developers to create subjects and observers for those subjects
- main purpose is communication between components and global state.

```python
from zenaura.client.observer import Observer, Subject 

class LocalObserver(Observer):
    def LocalObserverUpdate(self, value):
        if value > 5:
            print(f"ObserverB: Value is greater than 5: {value}")

# Usage
subject = Subject()
observer_a = ConcreteObserverA()
observer_b = ConcreteObserverB()

subject.attach(observer_a)
subject.attach(observer_b)

subject.value = 3  # Observers notified
subject.value = 8  # Observers notified again
```

---

### Tags

- Node class representing a node in virtual dom
- Attribute class representing node attribute in virtual dom
- Taq builder , fluent interface pattern to write html code fast
    - with_attribute : attach attribute to html node.
    - with_child : nest child within the parent node
    - with_styles: add styles to node
    - with_classes: add multiple class names
    - with_class: add single or many class names as string.
- HTMLTags :
    - class for the fluent interface pattern, return a TagBuilder instance for known html tags.

### Mutator

- I love react, the client side of zenaura is mostly inspired by react, react is very reactive, the core blessing feature in react can be a nightmare sometimes, there is no-cost whatsoever of a re-render , but sometimes having multiple re-renders can effect the user-experience, also developer sanity.
- so zenaura approaches things differently

```python
	@mutator
	def increment(self) -> None:
		self.set_state(CounterState(count=self.get_state().count + 1))
		
	@mutator
	def decrease(self) -> None:
		self.set_state(CounterState(count=self.get_state().count - 1))
```

decorating event handlers with mutator will trigger the virtual dom diffing algorithm. 

One example of this is forms, usually developers use setState with forms in react, while the user is entering information , the component rerender multiple times do state change.

With zenaura, you can have set the state for the data as much as you want, and have mutator function for errors and validation.

## Server

- For testing client & server router I used flask app for now to serve the client as static directory and navigate requests to the client based on client routes.

```python
from flask import Flask, send_file

from .public.routes import ClientRoutes

app = Flask(__name__,
            static_folder="public"
            )

@app.route(ClientRoutes.counter.value)
@app.route(ClientRoutes.home.value)
def root():
    return send_file('public/index.html')
```
