### Performance Enhancements

- Extensive benchmark tests conducted and optimizations implemented for a significantly faster compilation process.

### New Page Component

- **Introducing the `Page` Component:** A new fundamental building block in Zenaura applications, the `Page` component acts as a container for other components and is the sole entity that can be mounted on a route. This brings numerous benefits:
    - **Cleaner Code Structure:** Streamlines your source code, making it more readable and maintainable.
    - **Predictable Structure:** Establishes a clear and consistent architecture for Zenaura client applications.
    - **Encapsulation:** Each `Page` encapsulates its child components, promoting better code organization and data management.
    - **Consistency:** Standardizes the way multiple components are grouped together, ensuring a uniform development approach.

### Code Example (Before & After)

```
# Before
router.addRoute(Route(
    title="counter",
    path=ClientRoutes.counter.value,
    comp=Page(countersComp)
))

# After (Improved)
router.addRoute(Route(
    title="counter",
    path=ClientRoutes.counter.value,
    comp=Page([counter1, counter2])
))

```

note : component will be mount on page in their list order.

### Limited and Reusable Components

- **Improved Component Design:** Zenaura class components are now limited by default, preventing unintended reuse and promoting more explicit code design.
- **`@Reusable` Decorator:** To explicitly mark a component as reusable, simply decorate it with `@Reusable`.
- **Error Handling:** Attempting to reuse a limited component will raise an error, guiding you to decorate it appropriately.
- **Cleaner Code:** This approach results in a more Pythonic codebase with clear distinctions between limited and reusable components.

### Code Example

```
class ThisIsLimited(Component):
    pass

# No error (first instance)
c1 = ThisIsLimited()

# Error (attempting reuse)
c2 = ThisIsLimited()

@Reusable  # Decorator for reuse
class ThisIsReusable(Component):
    pass

# No errors (reusable)
c1 = ThisIsReusable()
c2 = ThisIsReusable()

```

### Lifecycle Changes

- **Removed Lifecycle Methods:**
    - `unmount` (implicitly handled for memory efficiency)
    - `componentWillUnmount`, `componentWillMount` (unsafe and prone to misuse)
- **Renamed Method:**
    - `componentDidMount` renamed to `attached`
- **Render Lifecycle:** Unchanged
- **Pre-compiled Table:** Introduced for potential pre-compilation and caching from disk.
